The idea behind the design of this boilerplate, is to provide a native-like development UX on the web.


# This boilerplate should cover projects that:

- use PWA features
- use gesture animations
- use webassembly compiled from C++ (audio/image processing, games)

# Does not cover projects that:

- need static code generation
- SEO is a key feature
